""" 
This is a demo for how to use the flirimageextractor library.

The library assumes that exiftool is installed and added to PATH as 'exiftool'. 
The library will not work unless this is done.
Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the exiftool path in the 'exiftool_path' attribute.

The thermal values that are returned by this library might not match the theramal values given by the camera. The reason for this is that the library is not designed for every flir camera. The library uses internal constants to calculate the temperature from the sensor data. If you want to fix this, you will have to enter the source code of this library, find the static method called 'raw2temp' and change the constants to approripate values for your use case.
